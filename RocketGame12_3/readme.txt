This is a problem from Python Crash Course
Chapter 12 problem 3:

12-3. Rocket: Make a game that begins with a rocket in the center of the screen.
Allow the player to move the rocket up, down, left, or right using the four arrow keys.
Make sure the rocket never moves beyond any edge of the screen.

This is my solution to the problem.  Do note that I had reviewed the chapter so I used a lot of the same ideas
as found in the chapter.  I then tried to code it myself to my best ability.  If I needed help I would look at
chapter problem code to see where I was going wrong.
